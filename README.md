## About The Project

The goal behind this project was to understand ES6 Modules, and package managment and asset management with Webpack.
The idea was to make a simple web page for a resturant entirely with JavaScript and let webpack do the magic with bundling the files and rendering the HTML.

## What I learned:

- What npm is and how with time it tranistioned from being used only in the backend to the frontend.

- What Webpack is and how it helps us bundle JavaScript modules into one file.

- What depenedcies are and how to manage them using package.json file

-The benefit of using ES6 Modules to keep different part of the code cleanly seperated which make writing and maintaing a lot easier.

## What I struggled with:

Using npm and installing packages and Webpack on my old Mac which is really error prone (mid-2010 mac).
fixed it by installing Linux on my Dell XPS laptop and finished the project there.
Linux is a lot of fun!
